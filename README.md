# Obsolete

This repository contained too many distinct projects, making tracking its updates messy. It has been split into several new repositories:

- <https://github.com/gedcom7code/c-converter> An ANSI-C command-line converter from GEDCOM 5.5.1 to 7.0
- <https://github.com/gedcom7code/js-parser> A Javascript DOM-style parser for GEDCOM 7.0
- <https://github.com/gedcom7code/test-files> A work-in-progress set of paired 5.5.1 and 7.0 files for testing conversion

See also <https://github.com/gedcom7code/> for other projects as they get added.
